# my-training-with-data---project-1
data analysis in the field of accounting, attendance and the quality of part of the season while working as a private mathematics teacher.

The source data is my own, I collected and created it myself. 
The data has previously been changed so that it does not present true information. 
This dataset does not contain real personal data, addresses, etc. :)

source: "math_april_may_summary" .csv file
analyzes and transformations: Posgresql

I made the analyzes for my own use, I wanted to check several key factors needed to assess the quality of the classes I run and plan movements for the next season
